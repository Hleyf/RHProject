    I'm a lonely component waiting to be completed.
    <!-- TODO: General input search that works in both lists -->
    <!-- TODO: Need to handle empty lists nicely  -->
    <!--TODO: two contact lists: "Your contacts" and "Lets stalk someone" (provisional name) -->

    <!-- TODO: fields needed: id (for sending the request or moving into a view), picture (pink dot atm), player name, user name -->
    <!-- it might be interesting to add  player name and user name in the same field, but be sure the list doesn't feel empty.  -->
